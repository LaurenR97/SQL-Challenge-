# SQL-Challenge-

Overview
This project involves designing a database schema for the Pewlett Hackard employee data from the 1980s and 1990s. The data includes information about employees, departments, salaries, titles, department managers, and department-employee relationships. This README file provides an overview of the database schema. Tables were created from 6 different csv files to pull data as well as join data to create tables to meet criteria.
